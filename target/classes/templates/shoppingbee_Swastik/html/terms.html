At Shoppingbee, </span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between </span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Buyers and Sellers.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"><strong>What is a 'dispute'?</strong></span></p> <p>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">connection with a transaction on the Website.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"><strong>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</strong></span></p> <p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely </span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.</span></p> <p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's </span><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</span></p> <p><strong>How is a 'dispute' created?</strong></p> <p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@Shoppingbee.com,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">while the Seller can write to ss@Shoppingbee.com, in order to raise a dispute.
